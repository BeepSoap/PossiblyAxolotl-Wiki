# Axolotl Museum

Axolotl Museum was PossiblyAxolotl's first released game. It was originally made for a grade 8 science class as opposed to making a PowerPoint[^1] presentation in [GB Studio](https://www.gbstudio.dev/). The player, as well as some other assets, are reused from [Ax's Great Axventure](/axventure), PossiblyAxolotl's first GB Studio project. It was released on October 30, 2020.
