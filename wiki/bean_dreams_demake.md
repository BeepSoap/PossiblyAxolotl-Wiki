# Bean Dreams Demake

Bean Dreams Demake is, fittingly, a demake of Bean Dreams.

## History

[Bean Dreams](https://web.archive.org/web/20191102091410/http://beandreamsgame.com/) and [Bean's Quest](https://web.archive.org/web/20190921153957/http://www.kumobius.com/beansquest/) by Kumobius[^1] were big inspirations to PossiblyAxolotl in their game development projects. PossiblyAxolotl created a demake of these games in PICO-8[^2] in February 2021, but it is no longer available. The code was later reused for [Bean Bounce](/bean_bounce).
