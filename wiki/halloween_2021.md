# Unnamed Halloween Game

In 2021 PossiblyAxolotl was going to make a first person Halloween game. The plan was to have a voiceover guiding you through challenges to get to someone's house and get candy, but it never developed far beyond the initial outside scene. It had a low-res art style which PossiblyAxolotl continuously goes back to for future 3D projects.
