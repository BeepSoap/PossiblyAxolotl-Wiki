### These instructions are unfinished. Please wait.

If you'd like to contribute to the wiki here's the best way to.

## Editing existing pages
If you want to edit an existing page click the `edit` button at the top of the page. This will open the GitHub repo to the file you will be editing. **Do not change the filename unless necessary.** Once finished click the `Commit changes...` button and give a description of what you did.

## Creating new pages
To create a new page, click the `create` button at the top of the page. Please ensure your wiki page is inside the `wiki/` directory, as well as any appropriate subdirectories such as `wiki/games/jam_games`. Also make sure your filename ends with .md, and uses underscores rather than spaces such as `formatting_instructions.md`. Once finished click the `Commit changes...` button and give a description of what you did.
