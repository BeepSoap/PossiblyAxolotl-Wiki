They are currently working on [multiple games](/games#upcoming). PossiblyAxolotl has been developing games since late 2020 and making videos for their main channel since May, 2021[^2]. Their first video was created for a class project where they taught their grade 8 class how to make videos[^3]. Recently PossiblyAxolotl started doing 3D animation in their videos.
