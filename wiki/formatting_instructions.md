## Keep in mind
Prose.io is a third party service used to edit markdown pages. Not everything is previewed accurately through this service but it makes creating and editing pages easier. You are not required to use it.

## Editing existing pages
If you want to edit an existing page click the edit button next to the "prose.io" text. [Prose.io](https://prose.io) is a third party service that makes editing markdown extremely easy. If you'd prefer you can use the regular edit button but it's not recommended.

## Creating new pages
To create a new page, click the create button next to the "prose.io" text. As explained above, prose.io is a useful third party service that makes it easier to edit markdown. Make sure your file is in the wiki/ directory, as well as any appropriate subdirectories such as games/ or videos/ for example.
