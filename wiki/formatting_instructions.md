If you'd like to contribute to the wiki here's the best way to.

## Editing existing pages
If you want to edit an existing page click the edit button next to the "prose.io" text. [Prose.io](https://prose.io) is a third party service that makes editing markdown extremely easy. If you'd prefer you can use the regular edit button but it's not recommended.

## Creating new pages
To create a new page, click the create button next to the "prose.io" text. As explained above, prose.io is a useful third party service that makes it easier to edit markdown[^1].
