# Formatting / contributing instructions

If you'd like to contribute to the wiki here's the best way to.

## Editing existing pages
If you want to edit an existing page click the `Edit` button at the top of the page. This will open the GitHub repo to the file you will be editing. **Do not change the filename unless necessary.** Once finished click the `Commit changes...` button and give a description of what you did.

## Creating new pages
To create a new page, click the `Add new` button at the top of the page. Please ensure your wiki page is inside the `wiki/` directory and **not** in any subdirectories (such as `wiki/games/rocket_bits.md`). This ensures there is no overlap between page titles. Also make sure your filename ends with .md, and uses underscores rather than spaces such as `formatting_instructions.md`. This will be the name used in the page url. Once finished click the `Commit changes...` button and give a description of what you did.

## Formatting pages
Always begin your page with a header of the title. This will be the name shown on the pages list. Keep the majority of your text plain, without any extra formatting such as this. You can emphasize text using **bold**, *italics*, and more seen in the markdown [basic syntax guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and [extended syntax guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/) such as references[^1] and `code blocks`. In order to create a reference, put `[^#]` where # is the reference number where the reference should be, and at the bottom of the page put `[^#]: foo` where # is the same number and foo is the text you would like to reference. To insert an image, place the cursor where you'd like, then drag and drop the file in or select it with the bar at the bottom of the edit box. If you would like to move it simply move the embed code somewhere else.

Also feel free to leave comments anywhere you feel necessary with `[comment]: <> (text to comment)` and look at the source of this page to understand some concepts better. Also feel free to change page formatting for some pages, especially if it improves the appeal / readability of pages.
