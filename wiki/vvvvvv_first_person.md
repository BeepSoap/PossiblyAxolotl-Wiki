# VVVVVV But First Person

*VVVVVV But First Person* was a first person remake of Terry Cavanagh's [VVVVVV](https://thelettervsixtim.es). PossiblyAxolotl originally created this to be the game featured in their first video, but they claim they "sat there for half an hour with [their] script open before leaving."[^1]
