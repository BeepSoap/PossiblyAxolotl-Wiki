# Ax's Great Axventure

Ax's Great Axventure was going to be a quirky, fourth wall-breaking RPG for Gameboy and home computers. It was developed in the year 2020 as PossiblyAxolotl's first ever video game but never got far enough into development to release. Assets are reused in [Axolotl Museum](/axolotl_museum)
